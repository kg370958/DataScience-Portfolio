# DataScience-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! Here, you'll find a comprehensive showcase of my expertise and accomplishments in the field of data science, spanning various domains and methodologies. Each project represents a deep dive into cutting-edge techniques and rigorous analysis, aimed at solving real-world problems and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in data-driven decision-making.

## Projects

### 1. Time Series Analysis for Stock Price Prediction
Using advanced time series modeling techniques, I've developed predictive models to forecast stock prices with high accuracy. By leveraging historical data and employing sophisticated algorithms, my models provide valuable insights for investors and traders, enabling informed decision-making in volatile financial markets.

### 2. Bayesian Analysis on Customer Purchasing Intention
Employing Bayesian methods, I've conducted in-depth analysis on customer purchasing behavior. By understanding the underlying probabilities and uncertainties, I've tried to optimize resources used in marketing.

### 3. Enhancing Text Generation with Transfer Learning and Diverse Decoding Strategies: A Transformer-based Approach
In this project, I've delved into cutting-edge methodologies aimed at augmenting transformer networks with domain-specific insights through knowledge diffusion techniques, leveraging transfer learning as a pivotal component. By harnessing the power of transfer learning, I've adapted pre-trained models to specific domains or tasks, enabling faster convergence and improved performance on targeted text generation tasks. Additionally, I've integrated techniques such as fine-tuning and data augmentation to further enhance the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. Furthermore, I've explored the implementation of diverse decoding strategies, including beam search, nucleus sampling, and top-k sampling, to facilitate more diverse and contextually relevant text generation. Through these enhancements, my project not only achieves superior performance in natural language processing tasks but also offers practical solutions for generating high-quality text across a variety of domains and applications.

### 4. Confident Capsules: Robust Image Recognition with Error Correction and Advanced Learning Techniques
In this project, I've pioneered a groundbreaking approach to image recognition by seamlessly integrating Capsule Networks with advanced confident learning techniques, specifically tailored to correct label errors. By harnessing the power of Capsule Networks alongside sophisticated confident learning methodologies, our model not only excels at discerning complex visual patterns across diverse datasets, as demonstrated by our experiments on CIFAR data, but also possesses the capability to identify and rectify label errors during training. This fusion ensures robustness to noisy and erroneous labels, enhancing the model's accuracy and reliability in real-world scenarios. The implications of our methodology extend beyond traditional computer vision applications, with potential uses spanning autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and more.
